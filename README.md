This is the first project in my journey to becoming a full stack sofware engineer. In this file, I have been able to explore editors like emacs, basic commands in emacs and basic commands in VI.
it is important because it acts as a reference fproject and the start of my journey
through it I would be able to track my progress in GIT, and everything I am learning
